Compiling. Must be compiled with g++ 4.6 or higher for certain c++11 features






This program receives a list of Genes and Clusters and iteratively spits out every column comparison.

Format should the following ( see exampleData.txt for complete example )

One Header line as thus with as many Genome Names as needed, seperated by TABS


Header	GenomeName1	GenoneName2	GenomeNameN

And as many info lines as needed, with each line containing one entry per Genome Name. 1 Means the Cluster is represented in the Genome, 0 it is not.



ClusterID	0	1	0
ClusterID2	1	0	1
